        <h2>Welcome to Child Protection</h2>
        <p class="bold">The protection of children from all forms of violence is a fundamental right enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
        <p class="italic">The inclusion of a specific target (SDG 16.2) in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to end all forms of violence against children gives renewed impetus towards the realization of the right of every child to live free from fear, neglect, abuse and exploitation.</p>
        <p class="underline">Every year, one billion children experience some form of violence, whether emotional, physical, or sexual. A child dies from violence every five minutes.</p>

        <p class="red">Violence against children knows no boundaries of culture, class, education, income, or ethnic origin. It takes place in institutions designed for their care and protection, in schools, online, and within the home.</p>
        <p class="green">Risk factors include gender, disability, poverty, or national or ethnic origin, which place children in high-risk situations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Child marriage and female genital mutilation (target 5.3)</li>
            <li>Eradication of child labor, including the recruitment and use of child soldiers (target 8.7)</li>
            <li>Protection of children from bullying, domestic violence, sexual violence and harmful practices</li>

        <h2>About Child Protection</h2>
        <p class="bold">Several other SDG targets address specific forms of violence and harm towards children, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (target 5.3) and the eradication of child labor, including the recruitment and use of child soldiers (target 8.7).</p>
        <p class="italic">To gain a better understanding of the nature, extent and causes of violence against children and of measures designed to increase their protection, the United Nations conducted a comprehensive study in 2006 with clear recommendations for action.</p>
        <p class="underline">The Secretary-General appointed a Special Representative on Violence against Children to monitor progress on implementation of the recommendations of the study and ensure its effective follow-up.</p>

        <p class="blue">One billion children globally experience some form of emotional, physical or sexual violence every year; and one child dies as a result of violence every five minutes.</p>

        <h2>Prevention Strategies for Child Protection</h2>
        <p class="bold">Violence against children can be prevented and there has been real progress over recent years, as highlighted by the 2013 Global Survey on Violence against Children and the Annual Reports of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly.</p>
        <p class="italic">New partnerships and alliances are forming; new international standards on children’s protection from violence, including trafficking, sexual abuse and exploitation have been adopted; a large number of states have adopted a national comprehensive policy agenda on violence prevention and response, and enacted legislation to prohibit physical, mental and sexual violence and to safeguard the rights of child victims.</p>
        <p class="underline">Information campaigns have raised awareness of the negative impact of violence on child development and of positive practices to prevent its occurrence; and children’s protection from bullying, domestic violence, sexual violence and harmful practices are being tackled through new global initiatives.</p>

        <p class="red">Increased investment in generating sound evidence on the scale and nature of violence against children, and on effective strategies to prevent it, and in promoting and monitoring progress towards its elimination.</p>
        <p class="green">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development presents us with an historic opportunity to place the protection of children at the heart of the policy actions of every nation and to build a world where all children everywhere enjoy freedom from fear and from violence in all its forms.</p>

        <p class="italic">2019 represents a strategic milestone in this journey, with the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in July assessing progress on the implementation of the SDGs under the theme ‘empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality’ and reviewing the targets related to violence against children under Goal 16, as well as those under Goals 4 (education) and 8 (decent work and economic growth).</p>
        <p class="underline">World leaders will gather under the first General Assembly Summit to review progress made in the implementation of the entire 2030 Agenda providing high-level political guidance for the second phase of implementation of the 2030 Agenda.</p>
